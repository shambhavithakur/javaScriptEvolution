# JavaScript Evolution
I had written the content for this page and developed a rudimentary design a few weeks ago. I improved upon the design recently, after I began working on the landing-page project of freeCodeCamp. All my research and learning for the freeCodeCamp project helped me make this page better. 

Highlights of this page:
- the CSS Flexbox and Grid layouts give structure to the content
- a combination of CSS techniques and JavaScript render the responsive navigation and animations
