                    <p>JavaScript was created and put to use in 1995 at Netscape Communications Corporation. Netscape was a
                        computer services company that owned Netscape Navigator, a popular '90s web browser.</p>
                    <p>The source code of JavaScript was the brainchild of a Netscape employee, Brendan Eich. Brendan wrote
                        the code in 1995 with the purpose of making web pages interactive. The Netscape Navigator browser
                        was updated concurrently to include a dedicated JavaScript engine. This engine allowed JavaScript-based
                        content to run in web&nbsp;pages.</p>

                        in JScript, a language that it had developed in house. JScript had similar functionality as JavaScript
                        and had been specially created for Internet Explorer.</p>

                        was reluctant to include JavaScript in Internet Explorer and, probably, wanted an overhaul that would
                        have changed the fundamental principles of the language.</p>

                        introduced support for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and the strict mode. JSON is a format for

                        can consider using React. You can render React-based UIs on the client side in web browsers or on

                        in this release was the inclusion of classes and modules.
                    </p>
                    <p>The year 2015 also saw a change in the naming convention of ECMAScript versions. From 2015 onwards, ECMA
                        began to suffix the year of release rather than the version number to the names of ECMAScript versions—therefore,
                        ECMAScript 2015 instead of ECMAScript 6. This change was a corollary of ECMA's decision to release
                        an updated version of ECMAScript each year.</p>
